##What does this repository contain?

- Train and test images path names in the SUN RGB-D
- 37 Class labels for images both in training and test dataset compressed in the .tar.gz file.

This alleviates the burden of having to install MATLAB on your computer and parsing the excrutiatingly complicatted .mat files in the SUN RGB-D dataset.
